comes as a surprise to many people, even to those who have lived in the area, that the water that plays along the coast around Broadstairs, Ramsgate, Sandwich, and even Deal, is not the English Channel, but the North Sea.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/assets/images/broadstairs1.webp\" alt=\"Photo of the North Sea from the coast near Broadstairs\"></p>\n<p>If you were to imagine a line that crossed the sea in an ENE direction from Leathercoate Point, where the war memorial commemorating the Dover Patrol stands North of St. Margaret's Bay, to Walde Lighthouse just North of Calais, that line demarks where the Sea becomes the Channel.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/assets/images/broadstairs2.webp\" alt=\"Photo of the North Sea from the coast near Broadstairs\"></p>"},{"id":5,"title":"Wimbledon

through a Python/OpenCV pipeline: each frame's colour is sampled, and  a spot of average colour is produced from the combination of one second's frames.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Spots are laid out 60 per line to represent one minute of film time. The length of the image represents the number of minutes in the film.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A 24-colour Adobe swatch file in ASE format and a hex RGB colour file are available to download for each spotmap.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"/assets/images/blackhole.webp\" alt=\"Black Hole spotmap\"></p>\n<p>More images can be found <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/urbanwhaleshark/albums/72157649963155584/with/17126036787\">here on Flickr</a>.</p>\n<p>There are also a couple of online articles about the spotmaps website on <a href=\"http://www.fastcodesign.com/1671572/infographic-the-colors-from-your-favorite-movies-mapped-to-7200-pixels\">FastCoDesign</a>, and <a href=\"http://gizmodo.com/5972740/the-color-of-movies-visualized\">Gizmodo</a>.</p>"},{"id":2,"title":"Nan","date":"Sunday, 1 January 2006","summary":"Photo archive","tags":[{"id":0,"tag":"Nan"},{"id":1,"tag":"War"},{"id":2,"tag":"Hospital"}],"link":"nan-2","body":[{"id":0,"type":"para","html":"Nan is on the right."},{"id":2,"type":"image","src":"/assets/images/nan.webp","alt":"Nan in an operating theatre (black and white)"}],"cdata":"<p>Nan is on the right.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/assets/images/nan.webp\" alt=\"Nan in an operating theatre (black and white)\"></p>"},{"id":1,"title":"My Great Grandad, George W.
