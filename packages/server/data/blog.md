# Ramsgate Sands
## Tuesday, 18 December 2018

This is the view from the other side of Sandwich Bay where it hugs the Cliffsend coast to the south of Ramsgate Harbour. This looks back toward the Bay, and is the outer reach of the low tide. Here the North Sea drains away to leave vast stretches of sand for the thousands of sea birds that make their home here.
