# Journal

A simple blog with a focus on accessibility and performance.

All posts are written in markdown. A conversion process renders the markdown to JSON that the component system can use to build the journal.

A backend engine produces simple compiled minified HTML/CSS from the rendered page (and, eventually, separate pages for each post). The HTML can be progressively enhanced with JS where needed.

Work undertaken:

- Stage 1: Created with React
- Stage 2: Created with Preact
- Stage 3: Created with bespoke JS components system (49K)
- Stage 4: Compiled and minified HTML/CSS from stage 4 (31K)
- Stage 5: Re-created with Vue
- Stage 6: Re-created with Svelte
